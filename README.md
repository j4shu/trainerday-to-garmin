# TrainerDay to Garmin Connect

Automatically uploads the latest [TrainerDay](https://trainerday.com/) indoor
cycling workout to [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/).

## Motivation

TrainerDay can automatically export a `.tcx` file of your indoor cycling workout
to your Dropbox after you finish it.

However, the file doesn't get automatically uploaded to Garmin Connect, so you
have to do it yourself - manually. Not only that, when you upload the file,
Garmin defaults the activity type to "Cycling" and names it "Cycling", so you
then have to manually edit the activity type to "Virtual Cycling" and name it
something meaningful. The activity type is specifically important for me to
distinguish between indoor vs outdoor rides when viewing activities/totals on
Intervals.icu.

## How It Works

This script simply automates the manual process above. When you run it, it:

1. Prompts you to log in to Garmin. The credentials are cached at
   `~/.garminconnect` for future runs.
2. Finds the most recent `.tcx` file in your TrainerDay Dropbox folder.
   - Defaults to `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Apps/TrainerDay`.
3. Parses the workout title from the filename.
   - For example, `2026-06-09 20-35-37 - Z2 60%.tcx` becomes `Z2 60%`.
4. Prompts you to confirm before uploading. Press `Enter` to continue,
   or any other key to abort without uploading.
5. Performs the upload and edits to Garmin Connect.

Editing activity fields can only happen after the initial upload. The script
handles this by snapshotting your most recent activity before upload and then
uses that to detect when the new activity appears after upload. A pre-existing
activity is never touched.
